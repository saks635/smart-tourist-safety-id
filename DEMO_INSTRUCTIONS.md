- **Emergency Contact**: `+1-555-0123`
- **Travel Itinerary**: `Visiting NYC landmarks, Central Park, Times Square`

Click "Register Tourist ID" and approve the transaction.

#### 1.3 View Generated ID
- Tourist ID card will appear with unique ID number
- KYC hash displayed (blockchain-stored hash of personal data)
- All data is stored on the blockchain for verification

### Phase 2: Web Interface Demo (10 min)

#### 2.1 Tourist Registration Interface
- Clean, responsive design
- Form validation
- Real-time wallet connection status
- Bootstrap-powered UI with smooth animations

#### 2.2 Tourist ID Display
- Digital ID card with gradient design
- Shows unique ID, name, passport, contact
- Displays KYC hash for verification
- Active/Inactive status

### Phase 3: Mock Geo-Fencing Alerts (15 min)

#### 3.1 Location Simulation
Click the location simulation buttons:

**Safe Zone**:
- Status: Green "Safe Zone" 
- Message: "You are in a safe zone. Enjoy your visit!"

**Tourist Spot**:
- Status: Blue "Popular Tourist Attraction"
- Message: "You are at a popular tourist attraction. Have fun!"

**Danger Zone**:
- Status: Red "High Risk Area"
- **Alert Modal**: Pop-up warning about entering restricted area
- Message: "Warning: You have entered a high-risk area!"

#### 3.2 Alert System
- Modal popup for danger zones
- Visual color coding (red for danger, green for safe)
- Sound notification (if browser allows)
- Acknowledgment button

### Phase 4: Mini Dashboard (5 min)

#### 4.1 Load Dashboard
Click "Refresh Dashboard" to see:
- List of registered tourists (blockchain + mock data)
- Tourist ID, name, and current status
- Safety status indicators (Safe/Alert badges)
- Color-coded status bars

#### 4.2 Statistics Overview
Real-time statistics cards showing:
- **Total Tourists**: Count of registered users
- **Safe Zone**: Tourists in safe areas
- **Danger Zone**: Tourists in high-risk areas  
- **Active IDs**: Currently active tourist IDs

## ðŸ“Š Demo Script (Presentation Flow)

### Introduction (2 min)
"Today I'll demonstrate a blockchain-based tourist safety system that generates secure digital IDs and provides geo-fencing alerts."

### Registration Demo (8 min)
1. "First, let's register a new tourist on the blockchain..."
2. Connect wallet, fill form, submit transaction
3. "Notice how the unique ID is generated with a cryptographic hash of the tourist's information"
4. Show the generated tourist ID card

### Safety Features Demo (10 min)
1. "Now let's simulate the tourist moving through different areas..."
2. Click Safe Zone: "Green indicates safe areas"
3. Click Tourist Spot: "Blue shows popular attractions" 
4. Click Danger Zone: "Red triggers our alert system"
5. Demonstrate the alert modal and sound notification

### Dashboard Demo (5 min)
1. "The dashboard provides real-time monitoring..."
2. Show tourist list with status indicators
3. Point out the statistics cards
4. "In a real deployment, this would show GPS coordinates and real geo-fence data"

### Technical Overview (5 min)

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### MetaMask Issues
- Ensure MetaMask is installed and unlocked
- Check network is set to localhost:8545
- Import test accounts from Hardhat if needed

### Contract Deployment Issues
- Ensure local blockchain is running
- Check terminal for error messages
- Try redeploying with `npm run deploy`

### Frontend Issues
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure contract files are generated in frontend/
- Try refreshing the page after contract deployment

## ðŸš€ Production Considerations

### For Real Implementation
1. **Deploy to Testnet/Mainnet**: Use Sepolia or Polygon
2. **Real GPS Integration**: Connect to mobile device GPS
3. **Government API Integration**: Verify passport data
4. **IoT Sensors**: Real geo-fence hardware
5. **Mobile App**: React Native or Flutter frontend
6. **Emergency Services**: Direct alert to authorities

### Security Enhancements
1. **Multi-signature Wallets**: Enhanced security
2. **Zero-knowledge Proofs**: Privacy-preserving verification
3. **Biometric Integration**: Face/fingerprint verification
4. **Encrypted Storage**: Additional data protection

This MVP demonstrates the core concept and can be extended to a full production system with real GPS, government integrations, and emergency response protocols.
